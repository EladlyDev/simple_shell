# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
This is an implementation of sh, the bourne shell, which is the old standard
installed on all unix systems [more...](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.html)

The shell is the command interpreter that takes your input, commands and provides output
back to the screen, files, etc, [more...](https://github.com/rcgsheffield/linux-shell/blob/master/README.md)
